  <h2>Background and motivation</h2>

  <p>
    This assignment is designed to let you build an app
    of your own, so that you can see all its pieces.
    This is in contrast with your main class project,
    where your project team will build a client-server application
    and most likely you will become expert in your part of the app
    with only nodding familiarity with the rest.</p>

  <p>
    This assignment is supposed to be quite simple, because you should
    be spending most of your time working on the project.  To help
    keep it simple, you’ll do a tutorial on basic React, the
    JavaScript runtime that is the basis for most of the student
    projects.
  </p>


  <h2>A simple interactive game app</h2>

  <p>
    The goal of this assignment is to build a simple
    application using React.
  </p>

  <p>
    A secondary goal of this assignment is for you to record what you did.
    This is so that someone else can build your app, and so that you
    can see later what you did, to fix your app or to build a similar app.
  </p>

  <p>Start by reading the Hello World guide cited above.</p>

  <p>
    Next, build the simple tic-tac-toe game of the tutorial cited
    above.
    Use the tutorial’s Note’s steps with a local development
    environment; call your app “<code>tic-tac-toe</code>”.
    As you go, keep a log in the file <code>tic-tac-toe.txt</code> of what you
    have done so that you can reproduce the results later. This should
    not merely be a transcript of what you typed: it should be more like a
    true lab notebook, in which you briefly note down what you did and
    what happened. Write down every significant action that you take,
    including installing and configuring components as well as any
    code that you write.
  </p>

  <p>Next, take a breather and reread the source code of your app.
    Although you needn’t understand every little detail of what it does,
    it may well give you pointers about useful things to know about React,
    <a href="https://www.javascript.com/">JavaScript</a>,
    <a href="https://www.json.org/json-en.html">JSon</a>,
    <a href='https://nodejs.org/en/'>Node.js</a>,
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HTML</a>,
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets">CSS</a>,
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model">DOM</a>,
    <a href="https://beta.reactjs.org/learn/writing-markup-with-jsx">JSX</a> and
    <a href="https://beta.reactjs.org/learn/javascript-in-jsx-with-curly-braces">JavaScript in JSX</a>, and
    <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools">Chrome
      DevTools</a>,
    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_are_browser_developer_tools">Firefox
    dev tools</a>,
    <a href="https://beta.reactjs.org/learn/rendering-lists">React list rendering</a>,
    <a href="https://beta.reactjs.org/learn/preserving-and-resetting-state">React state preservation</a>,
    etc.</p>

  <p>Now, use your experience to build an app that lets you play a variant
    of <a href='http://a-garbutt1215-sb.blogspot.com/2013/08/mens-morris.html'>terni
    lapilli</a> (“three grains”), a popular board game in ancient
    Rome.  We’ll call this variant <dfn>chorus lapilli</dfn>
    (“dancing grains”) and you should call your app
    “<code>chorus-lapilli</code>”.</p>

  <p>Chorus lapilli is
    like <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe'>tic-tac-toe</a>
    in that players take turn placing pieces on a 3×3 board
    and the goal is to get three pieces in a row.
    However, it differs from tic-tac-toe in two ways:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>After your first three moves, instead of adding further
      pieces you must instead move one of your existing pieces to an
      adjacent empty square. Therefore, after your third move
      you always occupy three squares. The move can be up, down, left, right,
      or diagonal.
    </li>
    <li>If it is your turn to move and you have three pieces on the
      board and one of your pieces is in the center square, your move
      must either win or vacate the center square.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>Keep a log of how you built your chorus lapilli app
    in a file <code>chorus-lapilli.txt</code>.
    Like your other log file, it should be a
    complete set of steps to build your toy application,
    that you could give to someone else to reproduce your game.
  </p>

  <p>When you have <code>chorus-lapilli</code> working, create a
    gzipped tarball <code>chorus-lapilli.tgz</code> of it by
    using <a href='https://docs.npmjs.com/cli-commands/pack.html'><code>npm
    pack</code></a>. Use <code>npm pack</code>'s <code>--dry-run</code>
    option before actually running it, and record its output
    into your log.
  </p>

<h2>Submit</h2>

<p>Submit the following files.</p>

<ul>
<li>The files <code>tic-tac-toe.txt</code> and <code>chorus-lapilli.txt</code>.<li>The <code>chorus-lapilli.tgz</code> tarball.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <code>.txt</code>  files should be ASCII text files, with no
carriage returns. The shell
command:</p>

<pre><code>awk '/\r/' tic-tac-toe.txt chorus-lapilli.txt
</code></pre>

<p>should not output any lines.</p>
