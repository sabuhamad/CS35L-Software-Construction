<h1>Assignment 5. Low-level refactoring and performance</h1>

<p><small>[<a href='../index.html'>course home</a> &gt; <a href='../assign.html'>assignments</a>]</small></p>

<section>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p>This assignment is designed to give you some skills with
    low-level programming, which is used in later courses
    like the operating system class, as well as in
    real-world applications like the
    <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_Things'>Internet
      of things (IoT)</a>. You’ll start with a working program; you’ll
      add a few features,
      and <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_tuning'>tune</a>
      and <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring'>refactor</a>
      the program to make it better.
  </p>

<p><em>Note:</em> Use a private local Git repository (not a repository
  host like GitHub) to keep track of your work in this assignment
  when you’re modifying code, data, or <samp>notes.txt</samp>.
  Don’t put big output files into your repository;
  use it only for sources that you maintain by hand.

<h2>Homework: Tuning and refactoring a C program</h2>

<p>Keep a log in the file <samp>notes.txt</samp> of what you
do in the homework so that you can reproduce the results later. This should
not merely be a transcript of what you typed: it should be more like a
true lab notebook, in which you briefly note down what you did and
what happened.</p>

<p>You’re trying to generate large quantities of random numbers
  for use in a machine-learning experiment.
  You have a program <samp>randall</samp> that
  can generate random byte streams, but it has problems.
  You want it to be (a) faster and (b) better-organized.</p>

<p>You can find a copy of a repository for the
  <samp>randall</samp> source code in the
  tarball <a href='randall-git.tgz'><samp>randall-git.tgz</samp></a>.
  Unpack that tarball, clone the resulting repository,
  and look at the resulting source code. It should
  contain:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A <samp>.gitignore</samp> file listing built files that
    Git should ignore (and that you should not commit).
    Feel free to update this file if it’s incomplete for your work.</li>
  <li>A <samp>COPYING</samp> file giving license permissions
    for this program.</li>
  <li>A <samp>Makefile</samp> that can build the program
    <samp>randall</samp> and can build the tarball.</li>
  <li>A file <samp>randall.c</samp> that is a single main program,
    which you would like to modularize.</li>
</ul>

<p>Add <samp>notes.txt</samp> to your clone of the repository,
and commit changes to it as needed while you work on this assignment.</p>

<p>Read and understand the code in <samp>randall.c</samp>
  and in <samp>Makefile</samp>.</p>

<p>Modify the <samp>Makefile</samp> so that the command
  '<samp>make check</samp>' tests your program.  You can supply just a
  simple test, e.g., that the output is the correct length. You’re
  doing this step first because you believe
  in <a href='https://www.cse.unr.edu/~dascalus/Paper_JAMES.pdf'>test-driven
  development (TDD)</a>.</p>

<p>Next, split the <samp>randall</samp> implementation by copying
  its source code into the following modules, which you will need to
  likely need to modify to get everything to work:</p>

<ul>
  <li> <samp>options.c</samp> with header <samp>options.h</samp>,
    which does command-line options processing. Initially
    there isn’t very much of this.</li>
  <li> <samp>output.c</samp> with header <samp>output.h</samp>,
    which does the output.</li>
  <li> <samp>rand64-hw.c</samp> with header
    <samp>rand64-hw.h</samp>, which does the hardware-based
    random-number generation.</li>
  <li> <samp>rand64-sw.c</samp> with header
    <samp>rand64-sw.h</samp>, which does the software-based
    random-number generation.</li>
  <li><samp>randall.c</samp> should contain the main program that
    glues together everything else. It should include
    the <samp>.h</samp> files mentioned above, and use
    their APIs to do its work.</li>
</ul>

<p>You may add other modules if you like.
  Each module should <samp>#include</samp> only the
files that it needs; for example, since <samp>rand64-hw.c</samp> doesn't
need to do I/O, it shouldn't <samp>#include</samp> <a
href='https://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/stdio.h.html'><samp>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</samp></a>. Also, each
module should keep as many symbols private as it can.</p>

<p>Next, modify the <samp>Makefile</samp> to compile and link
  your better-organized program.</p>

<p>Next, add some options to your program to help you try to improve
  its performance.  Redo the program so that it has an
  option '<samp>-i <var>input</var></samp>',
  where <samp><var>input</var></samp> is one of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li> <samp>rdrand</samp> &ndash; the hardware random-number generation
    supported by x86-64 processors if available; <samp>randall</samp>
    should issue an error message and fail if it is not available.
    This option is the default.</li>
  <li> <samp>mrand48_r</samp> &ndash; the <a href='https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/SVID-Random.html#index-mrand48_005fr'><samp>mrand48_r</samp></a> function
    of the GNU C library.</li>
  <li> <samp>/<var>F</var></samp> (i.e., any argument beginning
    with <samp>/</samp>) &ndash; use the file <samp>/<var>F</var></samp>
    as a source of random data, instead of
    using <a href='https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/random.7.html'><samp>/dev/random</samp></a>.</li>
</ul>

<p> Also, redo the program so that it has an
option <samp>-o <var>output</var></samp>,
where <samp><var>output</var></samp> is one of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li> <samp>stdio</samp> &ndash; Use <samp>stdio</samp> output,
    as before. This is the default.</li>
  <li> <samp><var>N</var></samp> (a positive decimal integer) &ndash;
    Output <samp><var>N</var></samp> bytes at a time, using
    the <samp>write</samp> system call.
    If the <samp>write</samp> call reports a successful write of
    fewer than <samp><var>N</var></samp> bytes, do not consider this
    to be an error; just add the successfully-written number
    of bytes to your count of bytes written. The last output block might
    be smaller than usual, if needed to get the total size to be
    correct. You can use
    the <a href='https://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/malloc.html'><samp>malloc</samp></a>
    function to allocate your output buffer.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can
use <a href='https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/getopt.html'><samp>getopt</samp></a>
to implement your option processing.</p>

<p>Add some '<samp>make check</samp>' tests to check your additions
  to <samp>randall</samp>.</p>

<p>When debugging, you may find the <samp>valgrind</samp> program useful.
Also, the
<a href='https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizer'>AddressSanitizer
(asan)</a> and the
<a href='https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2014/10/16/gcc-undefined-behavior-sanitizer-ubsan/'>Undefined Behavior Sanitizer (ubsan)</a>
may be useful; these can be enabled with the GCC
options <a href='https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Instrumentation-Options.html'><samp>-fsanitize=address</samp> and <samp>-fsanitize=undefined</samp></a>,
respectively.
</p>

<p>If the program encounters an error of any kind (including
option, output and memory allocation failures), it should report the error to
<samp>stderr</samp> and exit with status 1; otherwise, the program
should succeed and exit with status 0. The program need not report
<samp>stderr</samp> output errors.</p>

<p>Finally, time your implementation as follows ... </p>

<pre><code>    # This is a sanity check to test whether you’re in the right ballpark.
    time dd if=/dev/urandom ibs=8192 obs=8192 count=16384 >/dev/null

    time ./randall 133562368 >/dev/null
    time ./randall 133562368 | cat >/dev/null
    time ./randall 133562368 >rand.data
</code></pre>

<p> ... except that you may need different numbers if your implementation
  is faster or slower. Also you should try various combinations of
  the above options to see which gives you random data the fastest.
  One option that you should try is '<samp>-i <a href='https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/random.7.html'>/dev/urandom</a></samp>'.</p>

<p> Record your results (including your slow results)
in <samp>notes.txt</samp>.</p>

<h2>Submit</h2>

<p>Submit two files:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The file <samp>randall-submission.tgz</samp>, which you can
  build by running the command "<samp>make submission-tarball</samp>".
  Test your tarball before submitting it, by extracting from it into
    a fresh directory and by running '<samp>make check</samp>' there.</li>

  <li>The file <samp>randall-git.tgz</samp>, which is a gzipped
    tarball of your private local Git repository and configuration,
    created by the command "<samp>make repository-tarball</samp>".</li>
</ol>

<p>Neither submitted file should be all that large, since it
should contain only information about source files maintained by hand,
as opposed to generated files.</p>

<p>All source files should be ASCII text files, with no
carriage returns, and with no more than 100 columns per line.
The shell
command</p>

<pre><code>expand Makefile notes.txt *.c *.h |
  awk '/\r/ || 100 &lt; length'
</code></pre>

<p>should output nothing.</p>
