<h3>Exercise 2.1: Navigating through Emacs source code</h3>

<p>The basic idea here is to get a mental model of how Emacs works
  by looking at a bit of its keybindings and source code.</p>

<p>Start up a fresh Emacs with a <samp>*scratch*</samp> buffer.</p>

<p>To warm up, compute (2<sup>607 − 1</sup>) × (2<sup>607</sup> − 1)
(i.e., <samp>2**(607 - 1) * (2**607 - 1)</samp>) in
the <samp>*scratch*</samp> buffer, by using the <samp>expt</samp> and
other functions.  This is the
14th <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_number'>perfect
number</a>, discovered in 1952.</p>

<p>Use Emacs to determine how many bits it would take to represent
this number in base-2 notation (not counting any sign bit),
by writing a Lisp expression that yields the number of bits
as an integer.</p>

<p>Type <samp>M-:</samp> and use it to compute
(2<sup>607 − 1</sup>) × (2<sup>607</sup> − 1).</p>

<p>Get a list of keybindings by typing <samp>C-h b</samp>.</p>

<p>Look for two keybindings: <samp>C-h k</samp> and <samp>M-SPC</samp>.
  <samp>C-h k</samp> stands for “Type Control-h, then ‘k’.”
  <samp>M-SPC</samp> is “Meta Space”; on good keyboards you can get
  this by holding down Alt while hitting the space bar, but you may need to
  type “Esc” and then follow by hitting the space bar.
  We will examine these two keybindings in more detail.</p>

<p>Type <samp>C-h k C-h k</samp> and describe what happens and why.
  (This should relate to the <samp>C-h b</samp> output mentioned
  previously.)</p>

<p>Type <samp>C-h k M-SPC</samp> and describe what happens and why.
  (This should also relate.)</p>

<p>Try out <samp>M-SPC</samp> on some sample text with a lot of white
  space, to see how it works.</p>

<p>Visit the source code for the function that implements <samp>M-SPC</samp>,
  by going to its help and clicking (or typing RET) on its source
  file name.</p>

<p>Notice how <samp>M-SPC</samp> is implemented in terms of a more-general
  function, which does not have a keybinding. Use <samp>M-:</samp> to
  execute this more-general function on a buffer, such that the
  function changes the buffer’s contents.</p>

<p>Similarly, use <samp>M-x</samp> to execute the more-general function
  on a buffer.</p>

<h3>Exercise 2.2: Scripting Emacs</h3>

<p>Use the Emacs command <samp>M-x what-line</samp> and see what it does.</p>

<p><samp>M-x what-line</samp> simply tells you what
  line you are on, not how many lines are in the buffer.
  Design and implement a command <samp>M-x gps-line</samp>
  that acts like <samp>M-x what-line</samp> except that
  it says “<samp>Line 27/106</samp>” in contexts where
  <samp>M-x what-line</samp> would merely say “<samp>Line 27</samp>”;
  here, it’s assumed the buffer has 106 lines.
  Do this by using <samp>C-h f</samp> to get help about
  <samp>what-line</samp>, navigating through that help to
  find its source code, putting a copy of the source code
  into a new file <samp>gps-line.el</samp>, editing
  that file, loading it into Emacs, and then executing
  your new command.</p>

<p>When counting all the lines in a buffer, simply count the number of
  newline characters that it contains.  This means that if a buffer
  ends in a non-newline, you should not count the characters after
  the last newline to be part of another line.  Also, an
  empty buffer has zero lines.</p>

<p>Test your function on buffers that do not end in newline.
  Your function should be able to say things like
  “Line 1/0” and “Line 3/2”.</p>

<h2>Homework: Python scripting</h2>

<ul>
 <li>The Python Foundation, <a
  href='https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/'>The Python Tutorial</a> (2022)</li>
</ul>

<p>Consider the old-fashioned Python 2 script
<a href='randline.py'><code>randline.py</code></a>.</p>

<p>What happens when this script is invoked on an empty file like
<code>/dev/null</code>, and why?</p>

<p>What happens when this script is invoked with Python 3 rather
than Python 2, and why? (You can run Python 3 on the SEASnet hosts by
using the command <code>python3</code> instead
of <code>python2</code>.)</p>

<p>Use Emacs to write a new script <code>shuf.py</code> in the style
of <code>randline.py</code> but using Python 3 instead.
Your script should implement the GNU
<code><a href='https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/html_node/shuf-invocation.html'>shuf</a></code>
command that is part of GNU Coreutils.
GNU <code>shuf</code> is written in C, whereas
you want a Python implementation so that you can more easily add
new features to it.
Your program should run on <code>/usr/local/cs/bin/python3</code>
as installed on SEASnet.</p>

<p>Your program should support the following <code>shuf</code>
options, with the same behavior as GNU <code>shuf</code>:
<code>--echo</code> (<code>-e</code>),
<code>--input-range</code> (<code>-i</code>),
<code>--head-count</code> (<code>-n</code>),
<code>--repeat</code> (<code>-r</code>),
and <code>--help</code>.
As with GNU <code>shuf</code>, if <code>--repeat</code> (<code>-r</code>)
is used without <code>--head-count</code> (<code>-n</code>),
your program should run forever.
Your program should also support
zero non-option arguments or
a single non-option argument “<code>-</code>”
(either of which means read from standard input),
or a single non-option argument other than “<code>-</code>”
(which specifies the input file name).
Your program need not support the other options of GNU <code>shuf</code>.
As with GNU <code>shuf</code>, your program
should report an error if given invalid arguments.</p>

<p>Your solution should use the <code>argparse</code> module
instead of the obsolescent <code>optparse</code>.
It should not import any
modules other than <code>argparse</code>,
<code>string</code> and the non-<code>optparse</code>
modules that <code>randline.py</code> already imports.
Don’t forget to change its usage message to
accurately describe the modified behavior.</p>

<p>What happens when your <samp>shuf.py</samp> script is invoked
with Python 2 rather than Python 3, and why?</p>

<p>The <a href='https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3111/'>Python 3.11 release notes</a> say that Python 3.11 is significantly faster
  than older releases. Can you measure the performance difference?
Use Bash’s <code>time</code> command to compare the performance
of your implementation when run via
SEASnet’s <code>/usr/bin/python3</code> (which should predate Python 3.11),
versus running it via <code>/usr/local/cs/bin/python3</code>
(which should be Python 3.11 or later),
versus running Coreutils <code>/usr/local/cs/bin/shuf</code>.
Use Bash commands like the following to time these three benchmarks (this
example is for Coreutils, and assumes <code>/usr/local/cs/bin</code>
is at the start of your <code>PATH</code>):
</p>

<pre><samp>  time shuf &lt; /usr/share/unicode/ucd/BidiTest.txt &gt; /dev/null
</samp></pre>

<p>For each of these three benchmarks, run the benchmark at least three times
on the text file shown above,
and report the median of the sum of the user and system times.
Do your benchmarks on the same SEASnet host, and document the CPU
and operating system version of the SEASnet host you used
by consulting the <code>lscpu</code> command and
the <code>/etc/os-release</code> file.
If your Python implementation runs on <code>/usr/local/cs/bin/python3</code>
but not <code>/usr/bin/python3</code>, do not benchmark it on the latter;
instead, briefly explain which features of the newer Python your program
relies on, and why.

<h2>Submit</h2>

<p>Submit the following files within a compressed tarball named
  <samp>assign2.tgz</samp>.</p>
<ul>
  <li><samp>gps-line.el</samp></li>
  <li><samp>shuf.py</samp></li>
  <li><samp>notes.txt</samp>, a text file answering questions
    (e.g., why structural pattern matching made no sense for your Python
    program), and
    containing any other notes or comments that you’d like us to see.</li>
</ul>

<p>All files other than the <samp>.drib</samp> files should use
  GNU/Linux style,
  i.e., <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8'>UTF-8</a>
  encoding with <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRLF#Representation'>LF-terminated lines</a>.</p>

<p>The shell command:</p>

<pre><samp>tar -tvf assign2.tgz</samp>
</pre>

<p>should output a list of file names that contains <samp>gps-line.el</samp>
  etc., with sizes and other metainformation about the files.</p>
<!--
<p>Or maybe more lines, if something has gone wrong.</p>
