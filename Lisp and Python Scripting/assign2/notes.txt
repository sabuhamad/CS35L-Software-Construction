Exercise 2.1:
1. Expression to compute that long number 2**(607 - 1) * (2**607 - 1)
    - (* (expt 2 (- 607 1)) (- (expt 2 607) 1))
2. Expression to determine how many bits to store this number
    - (+ logb (* (expt 2 (- 607 1)) (- (expt 2 607) 1)) 1)
3. Type C-h k C-h k describes what happens and why
    - C-h k C-h k
        - Describes what the key bind of C-h k does in detail, running the describe-key command, as well as the source file for the command because the C-h k command describes the command associated with the input of the key pressed after it which was C-h k (itself) in this case
4. Type C-h k M-SPC describes what happens and why, and how M-SPC works
    - C-h k M-SPC
        - Describes what the key bind of M-SPC does in detail, running the just-one-space command, as well as the source file for the command because the C-h k command describes the command associated with the input of the key that is pressed after it which was M-SPC in this case
    - How M-SPC works:
        - Reduces large amounts of white space to a single space
5. What's the general way to do M-SPC (whatâ€™s that general function)
    - General command: cycle-spacing
    - Can replicate M-x with the following steps
        -  M-:
        - (cycle-spacing nil 'single-shot)

1. What happens when your shuf.py script is invoked with Python 2 rather than Python 3, and why?
    - gives an error when trying to import the argparse module because argparse is not available in most versions of Python 2
