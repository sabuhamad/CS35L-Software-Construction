  <h2>Homework: Topologically ordered commits</h2>

  <p>
    Given a git repository, the commits can be thought of as having
    the structure of a directed acyclic graph (DAG) with the commits
    being the vertices. In particular, one can create a directed edge
    from each child commit to each of its parent
    commits. Alternatively, one can create a directed edge from each
    parent to each of its children. If a commit is a merge
    commit, it will have two or more parents. In that case, one has to
    consider all parents. Conversely, a parent can have two or more
    children if two or more distinct branches emerge from the parent.
  </p>

  <p>
    Follow these five steps and implement <code>topo_order_commits.py</code>
    using <code>/usr/local/cs/bin/python3</code> on the SEASnet GNU/Linux
    servers <samp>lnxsrv11</samp>, <samp>lnxsrv12</samp>,
    <samp>lnxsrv13</samp>, or <samp>lnxsrv15</samp>.
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <em>Discover the <samp>.git</samp> directory.</em> Inside a directory,
      when the script <samp>topo_order_commits.py</samp> (which
      doesn’t have to reside in the same directory) is invoked, the
      script should first determine where the top level Git directory
      is. The top level Git directory is the one containing
      the <samp>.git</samp> directory. One can do this by looking
      for <samp>.git</samp> in the current directory, and if it
      doesn’t exist search the parent directory, etc.
      This discovery process should only go up, and never descend into
      a child directory.  Output a diagnostic
      ‘<samp>Not inside a Git repository</samp>’ to standard error
      and exit with status 1
      if <samp>.git</samp> cannot be found when the search went all
      the way to the <samp>/</samp> directory.
    </li>

    <li>
      <em>Get the list of local branch names.</em>
      Figure out what the different directories inside <samp>.git</samp>
      do, particularly the refs and objects directories.
      Beware of branch names containing slashes. Read
      <a href='https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Git-Objects'>&sect;10.2 Git Internals &ndash; Git Objects</a> and
      <a href='https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Git-References'>&sect;10.3
      Git Internals &ndash; Git References</a>. One can use
      the <a href='https://docs.python.org/3/library/zlib.html'><samp>zlib</samp>
	library in Python</a> to decompress Git objects.
      To simplify this assignment, you can assume that the repository
      does not use packfiles (see
      <a href='https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Packfiles'>&sect;10.4
      Git Internals &ndash; Packfiles</a>), i.e., that the repository’s
      objects are all loose.
    </li>

    <li>
      <em>Build the commit graph.</em> Each commit can be represented as an
      instance of the CommitNode class, which you can define as follows,
      and which you are also free to modify or not use at all:
      <pre><samp>class CommitNode:
    def __init__(self, commit_hash):
        """
        :type commit_hash: str
        """
        self.commit_hash = commit_hash
        self.parents = set()
        self.children = set()
      </samp></pre>
      <p>
      The commit graph consists of all the commit nodes from
      all the branches. Each commit node might have multiple
      parents and children.
      </p>
      <p>
	For each branch, perform a depth-first search
	traversal starting from the branch head (i.e., the commit
	pointed to by the branch), to establish the parent-child
	relationships between the commit nodes. The traversal should
	trace through the parents, and for every possible parent–child pair,
	it should add the child hash to the parent node’s
	children, and add the parent hash to the child node’s
	parents. The leaf nodes for each branch will be the root
	commits for that branch, where the leaf nodes are the nodes
	without any parents. Let <samp>root_commits</samp> be the
	union of all the leaf nodes across all the branches. If a
	commit is not reachable from any of the branch heads, it
	should not be part of the commit graph.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
     <em>Generate a topological
     ordering of the commits in the graph.</em> A topological ordering for our
     case would be a total ordering of the commit nodes such that all the
     descendent commit nodes are strictly less than the ancestral commits,
     where nodes in <samp>root_commits</samp> are
     the oldest ancestors.  One way to generate a
     topological ordering is to use a depth-first
     search; see <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting'>Topological sorting</a>.
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
	<em>Print the commit
	hashes in the order generated by the previous step,
	from the least to the greatest.</em>
	If the next commit to be printed is not the
	parent of the current commit, insert a “sticky end” followed
	by an empty line before printing the next commit. The “sticky
	end” will contain the commit hashes of the parents of the current
	commit, with an equal sign “<samp>=</samp>” appended to the last hash.
	These hashes of the parents, if any, can be printed in any order
	separated by whitespace. If there are no parents,
	just print an equal sign, “<samp>=</samp>”.
	This is to
	inform us how the fragments can be “glued”
	together.
      </p>
      <p>
	On the other hand, if an empty line has just been printed,
	before printing the first commit C in a new segment, print a
	“sticky start” line starting with an equal sign,
	“<samp>=</samp>”, followed by the hashes of the children of C,
	if any, on the same line in any order and separated by
	whitespace, so that we know which commits led to commit
	C. There is no whitespace after the equal sign.
      </p>
      <p>
	Furthermore, if a commit corresponds to a branch head
	or heads, the branch names should be listed after the commit in
	<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicographic_order'>
	  lexicographic order</a>, separated by white space.
	Note that this rule does not apply to the hashes in the sticky
	starts or sticky ends.
      </p>
      <p>
	The commit hashes in the sticky starts and sticky ends are not
	considered as part of the sequence of topologically ordered
	commit output. They are printed only as a visual guide. So
	even if a commit hash has already appeared in a sticky start
	or sticky end, it still must be printed as part of the
	normal sequence of topologically ordered commit output.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>
  <em>Example 1.</em> Consider the following commits
where c3 is a child of c1, and c5 is a child of c4:
  </p>

  <pre><samp>  c0 -&gt; c1 -&gt; c2 (branch-1)
         \
          c3 -&gt; c4 (branch-2, branch-5)
                 \
                  c5 (branch-3)</samp></pre>

  <p>
    A valid topological ordering from the least to the greatest will
    be (c5, c4, c3, c2, c1, c0) which should give the following output
    (assuming the commit hash for cX is hX, and the triple grave
    accents (<samp>```</samp>) are not part of the output but merely
    indicate the start and end of the output lines):
  </p>

  <pre><samp>  ```
  h5 branch-3
  h4 branch-2 branch-5
  h3
  h1=

  =
  h2 branch-1
  h1
  h0
  ```</samp></pre>

  <p>
    A equally valid
    topological ordering from the least to the greatest will be
    (c2, c5, c4, c3, c1, c0), which should
    give the following output:
  </p>

  <pre><samp>  ```
  h2 branch-1
  h1=

  =
  h5 branch-3
  h4 branch-2 branch-5
  h3
  h1
  h0
  ```</samp></pre>

  <p><em>Example 2.</em> For the following commits where c6 is a
    merge commit with parents c2 and c4:

<pre><samp>  c0 -&gt; c1 -&gt; c2 -&gt; c6 (branch-1)
	 \         /
	  c3 -&gt; c4</samp></pre>

A topological ordering is (c6, c2, c4, c3, c1, c0), and the
corresponding output should be:

<pre><samp>  ```
  h6 branch-1
  h2
  h1=

  =h6
  h4
  h3
  h1
  h0
  ```</samp></pre>

  <p>
    <em>Implementation notes.</em>
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Do not invoke any Git commands in any way. For example, do not
      use Python subprocesses to call Git.  Come to think of it,
      do not invoke any other commands either; just stick to Python.
      Use <a href='https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/strace.1.html'><code>strace -f</code></a>
      to verify that your implementation does not invoke commands.
    </li>

    <li>
      The output of <samp>topo_order_commits.py</samp> should be
      deterministic. For a given Git repository, even though there
      might be multiple possible ways to perform DFS, multiple valid
      topological orderings and multiple valid outputs, different
      invocations of <samp>topo_order_commits.py</samp> should produce
      identical outputs. For example, since the iteration order on a
      set <samp>s</samp> in Python is not deterministic, one way to
      ensure determinism is to call
      Python’s <a href='https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#sorted'>sorted</a>
      function.
    </li>

    <li>
      Use only the modules in the Python Standard Library:
      <samp>os</samp>, <samp>sys</samp>, and <samp>zlib</samp> are the
      only libraries you need.
    </li>

    <li>
      Points might be deducted if the naming of local variables and
      functions are not
      in <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case'>snake
      case</a>.
    </li>
  </ol>


  <p>
    <em>Testing.</em>  Please
    use <a href='https://github.com/Rustinante/topo-ordered-commits-test-suite'>our
    test suite</a> to make sure you are on the right
    track. The <samp>README</samp> file contains instructions on how
    to use it. Note that passing all the test cases in the test suite
    does not guarantee a completely correct implementation.
